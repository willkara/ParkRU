He was considered an old school statesman: he had a congenial and persuasive manner an imposing figure and quick mind.  Foran was a champion of Cook College and the NJAES and spearheaded construction of the Agricultural Museum.        The first formal recommendation for a Plant Science and Biotechnology Complex is contained in the 1988 report of the blue-ribbon Committee on the Advancement of Agricultural Research and Technology (CAART).

Gibbons Residence Hall D - House A1-A2,Gibbons Campus was named for Thomas Gibbons.  Gibbons was born on December 15, 1757 in Savannah, Ga. Among his many occupations were lawyer, politician and steamboat operator. Gibbons purchased a summer residence in Elizabethtown, NJ in 1810. He began running steam ferries between Elizabethtown Point and New York City in 1818. He also ran the steam ferries from New Brunswick to New York City, disregarding the New York monopoly grant of such traffic held by Aaron Ogden. This led to the famous U.S. Supreme Court case, Gibbons vs. Ogden (1824), in which Chief Justice John Marshall upheld national supremacy in the regulation of interstate commerce. The land now known as Gibbons Campus, was given to the college by James Neilson, who was responsible for it being named Gibbons. The land was probably originally owned by Gibbons in connection with his ferry service between Elizabethtown Point and New Brunswick which began in 1817. Gibbons died May 16, 1826 in New York City.
